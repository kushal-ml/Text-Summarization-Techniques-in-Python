By conducting a sequela-level analysis of the health outcomes for these conditions, only cases where nervous system damage occurred were included, and YLDs were recalculated to isolate the non-fatal burden directly attributable to nervous system health loss.

Results yielded studies that either looked at a small subset of conditions, such as only cancers or COVID-19, looked at single geographies, or used Global Burden of Disease, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) results. Previous GBD reports on the global, regional, and national burden of neurological disorders covered a period from 1990 to 2016 and were limited to 15 conditions. In 2016, neurological disorders ranked as the leading cause of DALYs and the second-leading cause of death. The largest contributors to DALYs were stroke, migraine, and Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias. Other research groups used GBD 2019 results to quantify 18 neurological disorders or smaller geographies. Previous analyses excluded neurodevelopmental conditions that frequently cause lifelong disability, and neurological complications from conditions that affect multiple body systems, such as diabetes, syphilis, malaria, or more recently COVID-19 and Zika virus disease.\n",

We did not include conditions that are not wholly neurological, for examples diabetes, as we could not ascribe risk contribution specific to neurological health states. The number of risk factors assessed in GBD 2021 varies by condition on the basis of evidence of association and available data. Exposure to a given risk was estimated for each location, age, sex, and year using regression modelling, and relative risk curves were computed by pooling data from studies assessing a given risk–outcome pair, such as intervention, cohort, and case–control studies. For each risk–outcome pair, risk exposure and relative risk analyses were used to calculate population attributable fraction. Attributable DALYs were then calculated, defined as the expected decrease in disease burden if risk exposure had equalled the theoretical minimum risk exposure level.
